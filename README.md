## Brief description of project

This project aims to examine the impact of rain evaporation removal or reduction in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on convective self aggregation (CSA). Non-rotating radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) simulations were conducted with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) cloud resolving model. Rain evaporation in the lowest 1 km was progressively reduced and the effect on CSA was investigated. The physical processes underlying this type of aggregation (referred to in the manuscript as no-evaporation CSA, or NE-CSA) were analyzed and described.
